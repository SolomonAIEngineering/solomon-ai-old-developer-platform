I'll analyze this schema to identify potential features that could be built on top of this sophisticated file storage system.



Based on this schema, here are the key feature categories that could be developed:

1. Advanced Search and Discovery
- Full-text search across files, folders, and workspaces with PostgreSQL's text search
- Semantic search using vector embeddings (pgvector support)
- Fuzzy search capabilities using pg_trgm extension
- Multi-faceted search filtering by:
  - File types
  - Tags
  - Date ranges
  - Metadata attributes
  - Content similarity

2. Intelligent File Management
- Automatic file versioning with change tracking
- File integrity verification using checksums
- Preview generation for supported file types
- Access tracking and popularity metrics
- Hierarchical folder organization
- Custom metadata and tagging system

3. Workspace Management
- Hierarchical workspace organization with parent-child relationships
- Workspace templates for quick setup
- Customizable workspace settings:
  - Storage quotas
  - File size limits
  - Version retention policies
  - View preferences (list/grid/timeline)
- Workspace analytics and activity tracking

4. Security and Access Control
- Granular permission management via workspace_sharing
- Public/private sharing capabilities
- Access key generation for shared resources
- Audit logging of all activities
- IP and user agent tracking
- Compliance settings for GDPR/HIPAA

5. Automation and Integration
```typescript
// Example automation rule handler
const handleFileUploadAutomation = async (file: FileMetadata, automation: WorkspaceAutomation) => {
  if (automation.trigger_type === 'file_upload') {
    const actions = automation.actions;
    for (const action of actions) {
      switch (action.type) {
        case 'generate_preview':
          await generatePreview(file);
          break;
        case 'notify_slack':
          await sendSlackNotification(action.config, file);
          break;
        // ... other actions
      }
    }
  }
};
```

6. Backup and Disaster Recovery
- Scheduled automated backups
- Configurable retention policies
- Encrypted backup storage
- Point-in-time recovery capabilities
- Backup status monitoring

7. Analytics and Reporting
```typescript
// Example usage analytics
const getWorkspaceAnalytics = async (workspaceId: string) => {
  return await prisma.workspace_activity.groupBy({
    by: ['action_type'],
    where: { workspace_id: workspaceId },
    _count: true,
    _avg: {
      affected_items: true,
    },
  });
};
```

8. Content Processing Pipeline
- Vector embedding generation for semantic search
- Content tokenization for full-text search
- Preview generation system
- Metadata extraction
- Content classification

9. Collaboration Features
- Team workspaces
- Shared access management
- Activity feeds
- Integration with external services (Slack, Teams, Jira)
- Comments and annotations

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these feature categories or provide more specific implementation examples for any particular feature?

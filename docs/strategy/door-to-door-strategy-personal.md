## **Key Adjustments and Strategies**

### **1. Focus on Early Morning Visits**

- **Target Businesses Operating Early:**
  - **Construction Companies**: Often start early, around 6:30 AM to 7:00 AM.
  - **Bakeries and Coffee Shops**: Open early to cater to morning customers.
  - **Gyms and Fitness Centers**: Busy during early hours with patrons before work.
- **Advantages:**
  - Decision-makers are often present in the early hours.
  - Less competition from other salespeople.
  - Businesses may have more time to engage before peak hours.

### **2. Utilize Evenings for Follow-Ups and Planning**

- **Follow-Up Communication:**
  - Many business owners check emails and messages after regular business hours.
  - Schedule follow-up calls and emails during this time.
- **Appointment Setting:**
  - Arrange meetings or demonstrations for weekends or early mornings.
- **Skill Development:**
  - Dedicate time to improve sales techniques and product knowledge.

### **3. Maximize Weekend Opportunities**

- **Saturday Focus:**
  - Many small businesses operate on Saturdays.
  - Decision-makers may have more time to engage.
- **Sunday Options:**
  - Depending on the industry and local business hours, consider Sunday visits.
  - Use Sundays for planning, skill enhancement, or rest as needed.

### **4. Efficient Time Management**

  - Complete as much preparation as possible the night before.
  - Ensure all materials and devices are ready to go in the morning.
- **Set Clear Daily Goals:**
  - Define specific targets for the number of visits, conversations, and demos.
